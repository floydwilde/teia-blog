## Teia at TezCon 2025

In June, Teia joined the Tezos creative community in Seattle for TezCon 2025 — a multi-day celebration blending music, visual art, and collaboration both in-person and online. Held at Kenyon Hall on June 28, the event featured live music, 74 curated art submissions, TezTones music match-ups, and a cross-continental live collaboration with the Bosque Gracias Residency in Argentina. Around the main event, several days of community-rich activities unfolded, making the whole experience feel more like an artist residency than a typical conference.

The energy was warm, collaborative, and refreshingly unpolished — artists sketching on napkins, musicians trading riffs, and visitors mingling with creators they’d only met online. This atmosphere fostered genuine connections and creative exchanges, setting the stage for a memorable event.

Following TezCon, [@ryangtanaka](https://x.com/ryangtanaka) announced that monthly Tezos meet-ups will begin in Seattle starting in August.

## Copyright and Curation Tabs

On June 25 2025, Teia introduced two small but impactful profile updates. The new **Copyright** feature adds a full registration workflow — including a dedicated `/copyright` route, preview component, smart-contract integration, and governance flow for proposal creation, voting, and execution. At the same time, a new **Curation** tab was added to profile pages, letting users showcase works they have curated (listed for sale but not originally created by them) through a dedicated `/curation` route. Both features build on Teia’s commitment to empowering artists with tools for attribution, discovery, and transparency.
