## Teia at TezCon 2025

In June, Teia joined the Tezos creative community in Seattle for TezCon 2025 — a multi-day celebration blending music, visual art, and collaboration both in-person and online. Held at Kenyon Hall on June 28, the event featured live music, 74 curated art submissions, TezTones music match-ups, and a cross-continental live collaboration with the Bosque Gracias Residency in Argentina. Around the main event, several days of community-rich activities unfolded, making the whole experience feel more like an artist residency than a typical conference.

The energy was warm, collaborative, and refreshingly unpolished — artists sketching on napkins, musicians trading riffs, and visitors mingling with creators they’d only met online. This atmosphere fostered genuine connections and creative exchanges, setting the stage for a memorable event.

Following TezCon, [@ryangtanaka](https://x.com/ryangtanaka) announced that monthly meet-ups will begin if you happen to be near Seattle and want to connect with other digital artists, you’re welcome to join our [**local meetup group**](https://www.meetup.com/creating-collecting-and-selling-digital-art-together/).

## Copyrights and Curation Tabs

On June 25, 2025, Teia rolled out two profile updates that quietly extend the platform’s mission of artist empowerment.

The new **Copyright** feature isn’t just a label — it’s a workflow. Artists can now mint a work, register it with an on-chain licensing agreement, and list it for sale knowing the terms are permanently recorded on the Tezos blockchain. Registration lets creators choose exactly which rights a buyer gets — such as reproduction, broadcasting, or derivative works — and optionally add custom clauses. Works minted on Teia or other Tezos contracts can be “verified,” while off-chain or cross-chain works can be registered if the creator can prove authorship. Once in place, the registration becomes a public, immutable record that strengthens provenance and attribution, even though enforcement still depends on traditional legal channels. For a detailed guide, see the [**TEIA Copyright Registration and Licensing Guide**](https://teia.art/objkt/869379).

Meanwhile, the new **Curation** tab gives collectors and curators a space to showcase works they’re selling but didn’t create, making secondary market activity more visible and giving curators a place to express taste as a creative act in its own right.

Together, these features push Teia further toward a transparent, artist-controlled ecosystem — one where both creation and curation have a place in the public profile.
