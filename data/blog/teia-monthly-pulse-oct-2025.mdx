_Teia Pulse is a new initiative tuned to our always-present community—born from the hic et nunc spirit and listening to what the feed is whispering right now._

## Similarity Clustering Highlights

Our clustering run surfaced three clear neighborhoods of practice that dominated September’s trading desk. Each speaks to how Teia artists keep bending media, tooling, and storytelling.

### Glitch and Analog Aesthetics

Digital error and tactile experimentation now sit side by side. ErnestoAsch’s [**“Painful yet relieving” (871971)**](https://teia.art/objkt/871971) pairs [abstract] and [glitch] tags to translate emotional tension into pixel drift, while nebular’s [**“where am I?” (873491)**](https://teia.art/objkt/873491) leans on a Panasonic WJ-MX10 to capture analog signal noise. The shared DNA is the artists’ willingness to introduce friction—glitch as both process and narrative device.

### AI and Generative Creations

Model-driven studios continued to thrive. gus_ale moved multiple editions of [**“Dalí style: Environmental pollution” (760613)**](https://teia.art/objkt/760613), carrying [ai] and [generative] tags and reminding us that collectors still respond to painterly machine riffs on earthly topics. Chris Follows pushed format edges with [**“Regency Cafe” (872846)**](https://teia.art/objkt/872846), describing it as an “Artificial Mesh Painting” that lives somewhere between render and ritual.

### Experimental and Film Photography

Photographers kept telescope time on the feed. gabriel.nebular’s [**“Playa de los caminantes” (873481)**](https://teia.art/objkt/873481) is a triple exposure captured on expired film, proof that scarcity also lives in the emulsion. Paraxeno_summertez’s [**“To the moon or back from it?” (871784)**](https://teia.art/objkt/871784) extends the motion blur lineage, reinforcing that analog craft remains a core Teia pillar.

## Tag Frequency Signals

The language layer behind these sales is just as revealing as the visuals.

- **[glitch]** led the pack, appearing across digital and hybrid workflows. Works like paolon’s [**“Burano” (163570)**](https://teia.art/objkt/163570) leverage the tag to signal deliberate distortion and invite glitch-friendly collectors to the edition.
- **[gif]** held its ground as one of the most used descriptors, with artists such as Lorna_Mills keeping looping animation at the heart of our daily feed.
- **[teia]** stayed prevalent as a marker of platform identity. Creators like nakedgalina continue to anchor their listings inside the Teia ecosystem by tagging their allegiance explicitly.

## Trend Identification

Beyond individual sales, macro trends hint at how the community is organizing itself this quarter.

### Community-Driven Art Events

Coordinated tag storms like **[gifday2025]** show that event culture is alive and well. myuji’s [**“optic_synapse” (872800)**](https://teia.art/objkt/872800), minted specifically for the celebration, demonstrates how shared prompts funnel attention and liquidity toward themed drops.

### Accessible Art and Low-Price Editions

Affordability drives discovery. Artist huo sold five editions of [**“find me” (768533)**](https://teia.art/objkt/768533) at 0.01 tez, underscoring a strategy that balances reach with modest revenue while strengthening collector pipelines for future releases.

### Process-Oriented Art

Creators increasingly foreground the making-of. In [**“miro una flor” (872870)**](https://teia.art/objkt/872870), gabriel.nebular documents the double-sided exposure of 35mm film, highlighting process transparency as a differentiator in crowded feeds.

## Cultural and Thematic Threads

September’s catalog also carried a set of recurring narratives that wove community values into the ledger.

- **Platform Identity and Collaboration** – cajabeats-visual-art.tez issued [**“Teia exists” (872695)**](https://teia.art/objkt/872695) as a love letter to the marketplace, reinforcing the collective authorship behind the platform.
- **Environmental and Social Activism** – vncnt.xyz earmarked proceeds from [**“dreaming of future forests” (298619)**](https://teia.art/objkt/298619) for conservation, continuing Teia’s tradition of impact-driven drops with tags such as [#savefairycreek].
- **Artistic Homage and Influence** – paolon’s [**“Pavillion” (163540)**](https://teia.art/objkt/163540) explicitly cites Kim Asendorf’s script lineage, illustrating how attribution and remix culture remain intertwined.

## Community Releases & Spotlights

Our “now” moment opens October with collaborative energy, charitable momentum, and format play.

### Sloth #41 – October 2025

The Sloth Zine collective returned with [**“Sloth #41 – October 2025” (873579)**](https://teia.art/objkt/873579), a 31-artist clean NFT comic bundle delivered as a PDF plus high-resolution cover art. The roster ranges from Arya Mularama to Naked Galina, with Samly anchoring the cover illustration. Tags like [comic], [magazine], and [sloth] keep the drop discoverable, while the mint continues Sloth’s long-running experiment in cooperative publishing.

### Tezos for Humanity 2025

@ArtForHumanityx kicked off the third annual **Tezos for Humanity** charity drive, running 1–31 October. Artists can mint fundraising pieces, collectors can dedicate swaps, and supporters can amplify the [campaign hub on Teia](https://artforhumanity3.teia.art/) or dive into the [event brief](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXTkaGtCccN8vI-JNhMSTjwdJ8CRYXOiVn47gkK6KgE/edit?usp=sharing) to plug in. Last year’s effort channelled on-chain art sales into humanitarian aid; this year aims even higher with the full community invited to contribute however they can.

### Keeping Pace With October Drops

We’re already watching the first waves of October mints for accessibility metadata, new AR experiments, and community-driven price experiments. Keep the [`#teia-answer-bot`](https://discordapp.com/channels/908672304236625970/955606531200667748) channel bookmarked for the latest daily, weekly, and monthly recaps—and ping us if you spot patterns worth threading into the next pulse.

## Novelty and Originality Signals

We also logged a suite of novel form factors that push the marketplace beyond static images.

### Augmented Reality Digital Sculptures

micahalhadeff’s [**“Anagram Two.” (592644)**](https://teia.art/objkt/592644) sold at 50 tez and arrived as an interactive GLB file. The work’s AR-ready design transforms collector devices into galleries, expanding expectations for object permanence.

### Collaborative Zine as NFT

The slothzine collective’s [**“Sloth #40 – September 2025” (872630)**](https://teia.art/objkt/872630) packages a 31-artist comic zine inside a single token, showcasing how cooperative publishing can thrive on-chain—and setting the stage for the freshly minted #41 edition.

### Accessibility Metadata

a_paufler’s video [**“apb-146 v2s4” (873549)**](https://teia.art/objkt/873549) flags flashing imagery directly inside the `teia_meta` field. It’s a small metadata tweak that signals a bigger community commitment to accessibility and informed viewing.

## What We’re Watching Next

This pulse threads September’s analytics into October’s early signals so anyone can build on them. Drop your corrections, missing data, or ground-level anecdotes in the blog comments or on Discord—we’ll fold them into the polished release and keep the momentum rolling “here and now.”
