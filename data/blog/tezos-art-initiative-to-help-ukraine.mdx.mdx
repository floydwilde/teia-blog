In support for our Ukrainian friends, brothers and sisters, [Veqtor](https://twitter.com/Veqtor) from Versum in conjunction with FxHash set up a shared [donation contract](https://tzkt.io/KT1DWnLiUkNtAQDErXxudFEH63JC6mqg3HEx/operations) that will redirect tezos to multiple charity orgs (listed below) in support of Ukraine relief, 

The Teia Community wants to help support this initiative alongside [Versum](https://versum.xyz/), [FxHash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/) and objkt.com, who all joined in donating to that contract.

The organisations chosen are all non-militarian (medical, aid, journalism, etc.) and the list can be changed if certain organisations are found to be problematic later on.

Everyone can help by supporting Ukrainian artists, donating tezos, raising money via NFTsales, collect or share fundraiser art and spread the word about this initiative!
