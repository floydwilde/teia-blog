_A new Year has come and we keep on building through the bear!_

The Winter is here (in some places :-) ) and Teia keeps on building: This month we are awaiting some huge UI updates and finally celebrating the legal recognition as a non-profit organisation. Apart from that, there are events upcoming, a new round of logo submissions for the new user interface, the official Teia Mastodon profile and a little word from our Content Moderation Team.

Oh look who it is, our good old friend, the Table of Contents, giving us a overview over this months topics:
